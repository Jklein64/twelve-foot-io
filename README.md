# twelve-foot-io

Safari extension to make it even easier to use [12ft.io](https://12ft.io).  Meant for personal use, but if it works for you then go for it!  I personally use this tool to not have to sign up when reading articles on [medium.com](https://medium.com).  I assume it wants me to sign up so it has a user profile it can track and collect data, but all that I want is the author's react/js/docker/ml/whatever insight lol
